This document is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Please read these Terms carefully. If you do not agree with any part of them, you should not use the Service.

	1.	Scope and definitions
1.1. “Bumm”, “we”, “us”, and “our” refer to the team operating the Service until a company is incorporated. Once incorporated, the company’s legal name and contact details will replace the “Bumm team”.

1.3. “User”, “you”, and “your” refer to any individual or entity accessing or using the Service.
1.4. “Credits” means usage allowances you may receive for free, earn through promotions/referrals, or purchase using Solana (SOL) to access features of the Service.

	2.	Eligibility and acceptance
2.1. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you use the Service on behalf of an organisation, you represent that you have authority to bind that organisation to these Terms.

3.2. The Service may construct or serialise transactions for your review and convenience. Execution of any blockchain transaction always requires your explicit signature using a compatible wallet you control.
3.3. You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, devices, and credentials, and for all actions taken from your accounts and wallets.

	4.	The Service; beta and changes
4.1. The Service provides AI-assisted tools to help generate, review, simulate, and deploy Solana smart contracts/programs, and may expose Solana Action/Blink endpoints to facilitate execution from compatible interfaces.

4.3. We may update, change, or suspend parts of the Service at any time to maintain functionality, security, or compliance, or to improve the user experience.

	5.	Accounts and access
5.1. You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date. You agree not to share or misuse access credentials.
5.2. We may collect limited information such as usage metrics, generated artefacts, logs, and your public wallet address, as described in the Privacy Policy.
