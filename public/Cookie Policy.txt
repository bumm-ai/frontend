	6.	Managing cookies
6.1. Cookie banner and settings. On your first visit (and periodically thereafter), you will see a banner allowing you to accept, reject, or customise non-essential cookies by category. You can change your choices at any time via the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer.
6.2. Browser settings. Most browsers let you block, delete, or limit cookies. If you block strictly necessary cookies, some parts of the Service may not function.
6.3. Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control. If your browser sends a recognised global privacy signal, we will treat it as a request to opt out of non-essential cookies where legally required.
	
	7.	International transfers
7.1. Some third-party providers may process cookie-related data outside your country. Where personal data is transferred from the UK/EEA to countries without an adequacy decision, appropriate safeguards (for example, UK IDTA or EU Standard Contractual Clauses) are applied by those providers. See our Privacy Policy for more information.
	8.	Data retention
8.1. Cookie lifetimes vary. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may last from minutes to months (analytics up to 2 years; marketing typically up to 3 months; etc). We endeavour to limit retention to what is necessary for the stated purpose.

9.1. The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly place non-essential cookies for users we know are under 13.
	
	10.	Changes to this policy
10.1. We may update this Cookie Policy to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or vendor settings. When we update the policy, we will revise the Effective date above. Your continued use of the Service after an update indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
