Privacy Policy

Effective date: August 01, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you access or use Bumm (the “Service”). Please read this Policy carefully. If you do not agree with any part of it, you should not use the Service.
	
	1.	Scope and definitions
1.1. “We”, “our”, and “us” refer to the Bumm team operating the Service. “You” and “your” refer to any individual or entity using the Service.
1.2. “Personal data” means information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an identified or identifiable individual. “Processing” means any operation performed on personal data, such as collection, storage, use, disclosure, or deletion.
1.3. This Policy applies to our website, application, and related services where it is posted or referenced. It does not apply to third-party websites, services, or applications that we do not control.
	
	2.	Data controller and contact
2.1. For the purposes of UK GDPR and, where applicable, EU GDPR, the data controller is the Bumm team until a company is formed. Once incorporated, the company’s legal name and contact details will replace the “Bumm team” as controller.
2.2. Contact: contact@bumm.io . You may use this email for privacy requests, questions, or complaints.

	3.	Information we collect
We aim to collect only what we need to operate and improve the Service.
3.1. Account and identification data: email address (if provided), public wallet address(es), username or display name (if provided), and team or organisation name (if provided).
3.2. Usage and transactional metadata: interactions with the Service (number of generations, simulations, or deploys), timestamps, feature flags, credits balances and redemptions, and high-level status of operations (for example, success/failure).
3.3. Generated artefacts and logs: code generated through the Service, build output, error logs, and support tickets. These may contain technical details necessary for debugging and improvement of the Service.
3.4. Device and technical data: IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, language settings, referral URLs, and approximate location derived from IP (city/country level), collected to ensure availability, security, and performance of the Service.
3.5. Cookies and similar technologies: session cookies and, where enabled, analytics cookies. You may manage preferences via your browser; however, disabling certain cookies may impair core functionality.
3.6. Information we do not collect: we do not collect or store private keys, seed phrases, or wallet passwords. We do not seek to collect special categories of data (health data, biometric data, etc) and request that you do not submit such information to the Service.

	4.	Non-custodial model
4.1. The Service is strictly non-custodial. You initiate and sign blockchain transactions from your own wallet. We do not hold private keys, seed phrases, or sign transactions on your behalf.
4.2. While the Service may construct or serialise transactions for your review, execution requires your explicit action in a compatible wallet.

	5.	Purposes and legal bases for processing
We process personal data for the following purposes and, where applicable, on the following legal bases:
5.1. Provide and operate the Service: to authenticate sessions, generate code, run simulations, and enable deploys. Legal bases: performance of a contract; legitimate interests in operating a reliable service.
5.2. Improve and develop the Service: to analyse feature usage, debug issues, enhance performance, and develop new features. Legal bases: legitimate interests in improving our products and user experience.
5.3. Safety, security, and abuse prevention: to detect malicious patterns (for example, attempts to generate “drainer” code), protect infrastructure, and enforce our Terms of Service. Legal bases: legitimate interests; legal obligations where applicable.
5.4. Communications: to send essential service messages (for example, system alerts, account notices) and, where you opt in, product updates or marketing communications. Legal bases: legitimate interests; consent for optional marketing.
5.5. Credits, referrals, and promotions: to administer credits purchased in SOL, free trial credits, and referral rewards. Legal bases: performance of a contract; legitimate interests in running promotions.
5.6. Legal compliance: to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and lawful requests. Legal bases: legal obligations; legitimate interests in establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims.

	6.	Sharing and disclosures
6.1. Service providers (processors): we use third-party vendors to host infrastructure, run analytics, process queued tasks, or provide AI/RPC services. These providers act under contractual obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.
6.2. Professional advisors: we may share information with auditors, lawyers, or accountants when necessary for legitimate business purposes and legal compliance.
6.3. Legal and regulatory: we may disclose information when required by law, subpoena, court order, or other lawful process, or to protect rights, safety, or security.
6.4. Business transfers: if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganisation, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to standard confidentiality obligations.
6.5. Aggregated or anonymised data: we may share insights derived from aggregated or anonymised data that cannot reasonably identify you.

	7.	International data transfers
7.1. We may process and store information in jurisdictions other than your own. Where personal data is transferred from the UK/EEA to countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as the UK International Data Transfer Addendum (IDTA) or EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
7.2. On request, we will provide further details on transfer mechanisms relevant to your data.

	8.	Data retention
8.1. We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Policy, including to meet legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
8.2. Illustrative retention periods:
a) Usage logs and generated artefacts used for debugging: typically up to 90 days unless extended for ongoing investigations or security purposes.
b) Account records and billing-related metadata: as required to support your account, enforce our Terms, and comply with legal obligations.
c) Backups: limited-duration backups may persist for operational continuity; deletion requests will be propagated to backups within a reasonable period.
8.3. When personal data is no longer needed, we will delete it or anonymise it in a manner that cannot reasonably identify you.

	9.	Security
9.1. We employ administrative, technical, and organisational measures designed to safeguard personal data, including isolated build environments, access controls based on least privilege, and monitoring for anomalous activity.
9.2. No system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You use the Service at your own risk and are responsible for securing your devices and wallets.

	10.	Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have the following rights, subject to legal limitations:
10.1. Access: request confirmation whether we process your personal data and obtain a copy.
10.2. Rectification: request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
10.3. Erasure: request deletion of personal data where it is no longer necessary or where consent is withdrawn (if applicable).
10.4. Restriction: request restriction of processing under certain circumstances.
10.5. Portability: receive personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller where technically feasible.
10.6. Objection: object to processing based on legitimate interests, including profiling related to those interests.
10.7. Consent withdrawal: where processing relies on consent, you may withdraw it at any time without affecting prior processing.
To exercise these rights, contact: contact@bumm.io (placeholder). We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.

	11.	Complaints and supervisory authority
If you are in the UK or EEA and believe we have not handled your personal data in accordance with applicable law, you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. In the UK, the supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). We encourage you to contact us first so we can address your concerns.

	12.	Children’s privacy
12.1. The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.
12.2. If you are between 13 and 17, you may use the Service only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian where required by law.

	13.	Marketing communications and preferences
13.1. You may opt in to receive product updates or announcements. You may opt out at any time using the unsubscribe link in emails or by contacting us.
13.2. We may still send you essential transactional or service messages even if you opt out of marketing.

	14.	Automated decision-making
We do not engage in solely automated decision-making that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significant effects within the meaning of UK/EU data protection laws.

	15.	Third-party links and services
The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

	16.	Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or other factors. When we do, we will revise the Effective date at the top of this document. Your continued use of the Service after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
